# isa-explorer-demo

Goal: Demonstrate effective display of ISA-Tab data.

We want to try out isa-explorer, https://github.com/ISA-tools/isa-explorer

Plan

1. Find isa-explorer, initial desk check;
2. Get isa-explorer running, example / mock data, on laptop / dev instance;
3. Get isa-explorer running, our real ISA-Tab data, laptop / dev instance;
4. Install on publicly visible instance
5. Install on maintained instance.

Progress

1. Done, looks ok;
2. Done, some fiddling of node versions, etc. Best to proceed by installing nvm first.
3. Done: Fixed the UTF-8 problem by editing the Investigation file myself. Made a bunch of modifications to our ISA-Tab files, and now it displays data. There are still wonky links and things.
4. Done. http://demo-isatab-explorer.hidelab.org/
5. 2 days?

Remaining to do:

1. publish controlled list of changes so that we can reproduce them / feedback.
